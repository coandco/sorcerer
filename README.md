CCG table simulator

This was a partially-completed project I worked on years ago and never finished.  At the time, Apprentice was the only workable non-MODO way to play Magic: The Gathering online, and while I was one of the two people maintaining it and updating the card database when new sets were released, I realized that it would soon become obsolete (due to built-in hard limits on the number of cards its database could hold).  To fix this, I began working on a PHP/AJAX table simulator to replace it.

I stopped working on the project when I found [Cockatrice](https://github.com/Daenyth/Cockatrice), an open-source client-server-based table simulator that was already in a workable state for most of the features I wanted to develop.
